# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/files/

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    # assets:
    #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
    #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
fonts:
  - family: Stockholm
    fonts:
      - asset: fonts/Stockholm.ttf
      - asset: fonts/Stockholm_Mono.ttf #Om du den är bold måste du speca en weight.
        weight: 700
      - asset: fonts/Stocholm_Slab.ttf
        weight: 300
        style: Italic
  - family: Trajan Pro
    fonts:
      - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
      - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
        weight: 700
